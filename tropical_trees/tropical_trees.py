#   A script that extracts data from a HUGE (60k+ rows, 60+ columns)
#   spreadsheet to help biologists do science.
#   Calculates the average height of the 8 surounding trees around
#   an individual tree, and returns a neat spreadsheet with
#   the individuals label, height, neighbouring average height, 
#   and death status.
